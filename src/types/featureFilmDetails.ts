        name: 'Laurie',
        backstory: `Laurie Carpenter was born with a chip on her shoulder. Even from a young age, the fastest way to get her to do something was to tell her that she couldn't do it.

"No, you can't try out for football." "No, you can't learn how to play guitar." "No, you can't take martial arts." Whenever she heard the word 'no,' a switch flipped somewhere deep inside her and she would do everything within her power to accomplish the very thing she'd been told she couldn't do.

While this quality turned Laurie into an ambitious, focused, and tough-as-nails woman, it didn't exactly win her many friends. Most people were turned off by her intensity, and a lot of people who came into her orbit were a bit scared of her. Even at 5 foot 10, Laurie gave off the vibe that she could break you in two if she felt like it, no matter how much bigger or stronger you might be.

But those who stuck around discovered a fiercely loyal friend who would go to hell and back for them. One thing was for certain: you definitely wanted Laurie on your side, and you'd better run for your life if you were her enemy.`

        name: 'Reiko',
        backstory: `Reiko Rivers was quiet and shy. She was the kid who hated being called on in class, who sat alone at lunch, and who was always the last one picked for kickball. Her goal in life was to attract as little attention as possible to herself. At least, that was her goal until she discovered track.

Reiko didn't want to try out for track, but her parents, in a fit of frustration over her unwillingness to do anything outside of her comfort zone, forced her to. And she discovered she was not only fast, she was really damn fast. She handily left every other girl on the team in a cloud of dust, and went on to break every school record as well as win State.

Reiko was still quiet, but she was no longer as timid as she'd once been. Why would she need to be, when she was the fastest thing on two legs?`

Sheila Smalley was adopted by Mike and Rhonda Smalley the year after the tragic death of their first daughter from (at least in their minds) the influence of Dr. Franklin Wright. Sheila was saved from the streets of India at a young age, though she was ripped away from her older brother who was taking care of her. She doesn't remember much from her years as a child in India. The Smalleys made every effort to shield Sheila from the events of the past and, namely, their murder of Dr. Wright. His transition into the dream world before death was unknown to them, but it would soon become known to Sheila.

Sheila was well-liked in school and had a lot of friends. She'd even recently gotten a boyfriend when a really smart kid, ok a nerd, named Tommy asked her to 'go steady.' Tommy really won her heart when he stood up to a group of jocks that were making racially insensitive comments to Sheila. He paid for it with a black eye and some bruises, but Sheila knew in that moment that she could trust Tommy to protect her no matter what.

When Sheila set her mind on something she could be very effective. She just had to overcome her fears first. She was a meticulous planner and strategist and as long as she didn't get paralyzed by fear and uncertainty, she was a force to be reckoned with.`

Nancy Lang was basically the All-American girl. An only child, she was constantly being doted on by her parents. In the rare instance where she did get into trouble, her father's position and influence as a ranking officer in law enforcement was usually enough to get her out of it.

Nancy suffered from night terrors, often thrashing violently in her sleep. Her parents were considering something for Nancy they'd recently heard about called "dream therapy" and apparently, there was a local doctor that does that sort of thing.

Nancy was a bright young woman. A senior in high school who was well liked. Her boyfriend lived just around the corner and, while he was a good guy, he wasn't someone Nancy saw herself with long term.

Nancy was always extremely resilient and persistent. She'd beat the odds even when they were heavily stacked against her.`

At recess everyone would crowd around Dolores and oooh and ahhh at the doll. Barbara was intensely jealous. She wanted to be the center of attention. She wanted Miss Baby Face.

So, she pulled Dolores aside one day and somehow, inexplicably, magically even, convinced her to hand over the precious doll. That was the day that Barbara learned she could convince anyone to do whatever she wanted them to. It was her super power, and she used it every chance she got.

But something was hiding in the cargo, and we brought it on board. A thing, a creature, an animal... no, it was a goddamn monster, and I let it loose on my ship!"

The Adult Evomorph is a large insectoid-like alien, with a white and red exoskeleton, and a scorpion-like tail. It has no visible eyes but does have a set of sharp teeth in its exposed mouth. When the Konrad first became infested after raiding an abandoned and decrepit space freighter, the crew had no idea that a hatchling Evomorph had returned with them.

The hatchling invaded the body of one of the crew by crawling into one of their orifices. Hatchlings incubate inside the host's body until they reach a size where the host is no longer sufficient in size or provided nutrients. At that point, it bursts forth from the host creating its own orifice and killing the host.

Younglings hunt and feed on whatever living beings they can find. They are incredibly quick and deadly. While their exoskeleton is tough, they can be damaged and even killed with human-designed weapons. They are also very susceptible to fire. Once a Youngling has fed on enough victims, it will evolve into its full-grown Adult form.

Adult Evomorphs can survive for several years on no food. They hunt purely for sport as they instinctually learn while being a Youngling, even though they are often only in that stage for a matter of hours. An Adult Evomorph is essentially a killing machine and will even attack other Evomorphs for sole superiority.

When there is nothing to kill, because the Evomorph is alone on a planet or ship, it will then begin to nest out of boredom. It does not produce eggs in large numbers making only one Hatchling each year. A Hatchling can only survive without a host for about a year itself, so it is extremely rare to have more than one or at most two hatchlings in an area at a time.

If an Evomorph is unable to find a new source of food, it will perform a process called morpholosion where it can use its dying body to preserve the Hatchling almost indefinitely. This process is the reason why Evomorphs have continued to exist despite the fact that they kill any and every living thing around them.

Eventually, the cycle continues when the hatchling is introduced to an area with a living organism. The hatchling has acute biological sensors and when it senses such a being, will "hatch" from the morpholosion cocoon to seek out the being as its host.

Evomorphs have eradicated full ship crews and even full planets, though they are often killed before such extreme destruction in cases where they find themselves among a highly populated, well-armed place or in a place with beings more dangerous than the Evomorph, which is rare but possible.

One thing is for sure, the crew of the Konrad is hardly a group that is likely to survive an encounter with an Evomorph.`

Unbeknownst to the other scientists, researchers, and staff at the station, Lissard had developed a mutagenic virus that could, in theory, transform humans into super-human versions of themselves with incredible strength, speed, and toughness. It was time to test the virus on human subjects, but knowing the risks, his client insisted on a remote location and secrecy. Not even his fellow residents of the station could know about the experiment... at least not until the subject's performance could be observed.

To cover as many bases as possible, Lissard recruited scientists from a variety of backgrounds, blood types, builds, genders, and ethnicities. To avoid any suspicion, he brought some parasitic worms with him and injected them with the virus. They were the perfect introduction vehicle and would do all the work by finding a human host all on their own. He only had to preserve them until they reached the warmth of the station, then release them, and wait. If the virus worked, the mutations would quickly follow and it would be quite evident if successful.`

        backstory: `Her friends started calling her 'Red' because she was always wearing the same red hoodie wherever she went. The nickname stuck to the point where some of her friends didn't even know her real name was Chantelle. Chantelle Gilliam to be exact.

Red liked to pull the strings of her hoodie tight so the hood would fit snugly around her head and face. She didn't like it blocking her peripheral vision. Red was always quick. Quick to engage. Quick to escape. Quick to be at her Grandma's at a moment's notice. Anything for Grandma.`

        backstory: `Gretel grew up in Storybook Village. Fairy tales are all she's ever known. She is no stranger to danger like witches, wolves, trolls, evil fairies... you name it, she's survived it.

Her brother would often take credit for their survival when telling townsfolk of their exploits, so Gretel's tenacity wasn't well known amongst the residents of the village. Hansel's boasting was annoying, but he was her brother after all. And to be honest, she was happy to let him have the attention. She much preferred the attention of the birds and other animals of the forest anyway.`

      name: 'Storybook Woods',
      description: `What if the stories you were told as a child were true? What if there did exist a place where tales and fables were a reality? Where magic and mischief were real?

They are in fact real, but it isn't what you might think. It would be impossible to get you to understand this fully, but know that the following statement is true. Every world imagined by the inhabitants of Earth does in fact exist. The imagination, daydreams, nightmares, and all of the fantastic creations of the mind are actual visions of real places and times in the known and unknown universe. You don't have to believe it (and most humans don't), but that does not make it any less true.

The location represents a dense, enchanted forest filled with landmarks pulled straight from folklore. You aren't just running through trees; you're navigating past The Three Pigs' Houses, The Grandma's House, and The Beanstalk.

The atmosphere is "dark fantasy horror"—think The Brothers Grimm rather than Disney. The paths are winding, and the location is designed to make you feel like the forest itself is closing in on you.`,

      name: 'Big Bad Wolf',
      description: `In the world of Final Girl, the Big Bad Wolf isn't just a large animal; he is an apex predator that embodies the terror of being hunted. He is often associated with Storybook Woods, a location that feels ripped from a dark Grimm Brothers tale.

The Nature of the Beast: The Wolf is depicted as a massive, bipedal lycanthrope-style creature, but his behavior is more akin to a calculated serial killer than a mindless beast. He doesn't just kill; he stalks.

The "Big Bad" Persona: He represents the classic "stranger danger" archetype. His mechanics—specifically his ability to move quickly and his "Ambush" style attacks—reflect the folklore of a wolf in sheep's clothing (or at least, a wolf that knows exactly how to corner its prey).

The Connection to "Red": While the game allows any Final Girl to face him, his primary thematic rival is Gretel, a nod to the classic fairy tale protagonist. The lore suggests a cycle of hunter and hunted that has played out across the Storybook Woods for generations.`

        name: 'Ginny',
        backstory: `Ginny Sandin was forced to be independent from a young age. Her family had plenty of money but it came at a cost. Both parents traveled a lot and they moved frequently. With her parents barely present, Ginny spent most of her time with nannies when she was young, and later alone as she got older. She was shy, an introvert, and would spend hours at a time hiking in nearby forests. It didn't matter if it was pouring rain or during a blizzard, she'd still go. These long walks were her favorite way to pass time, alone in her thoughts and at one with nature.

In her late teens, she saw an ad for a survival camp and knew she had to go. They were supposed to visit Egypt that summer and cruise the Nile, but for Ginny, that paled in comparison to spending a summer learning to survive outdoors. She excelled at the camp. At the end of the summer, students had to test their skills by surviving for a week in the bush. Most didn't stray too far from where they were dropped off, and some didn't even last the week. For Ginny, it took 3 days for them to find her after the test was done and even then, she had wanted to stay longer. It was after that summer that Ginny decided to move out and experience life on her own.`

        name: 'Ava',
        backstory: `Ava Tyler grew up in a rough part of town. When she wasn't helping her dad fix small appliances, she was typically mixed up in some trouble and usually a fight or two. She was opinionated, stubborn, and strong-willed, and 'compromise' was not in her vocabulary. She eventually learned to pick her battles, but it took a lot of battles to get there. If nothing else, she picked up some good fighting skills from her various scraps, and also some first aid skills from having to patch herself up.

When she was with her dad, she would spend hours watching him take things apart, carefully label them, and then put them all back when it was fixed. She loved spending her time tinkering with things and as a result, she learned to make do with very little, frequently repairing things multiple times instead of throwing them away. These skills helped her land decent jobs and employers were frequently impressed by her resourcefulness. When she finally made enough to move her family out of the neighborhood, many said she was just one of the lucky ones, but she knew better... her good fortune was the direct result of having to fight for everything she had and taking nothing for granted.`

The channels are tying them back to the other cult killings that have occurred in the past few months. Rumors say it might even be the same killers from the last set of murders that occurred years ago. If that's true, these killers have been at large for a long-ass time.

The Intruders are a "horde" type Killer consisting of three distinct slashers: Baghead, Redhood, and Zeke. Unlike other killers, their power is split between three individuals, each bringing their own brand of terror to Wingard Cottage.`
